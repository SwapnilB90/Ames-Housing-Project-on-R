# Ames-Housing-Project-on-R
The goal of this project is to analyze the given Housing data and predict the prices of houses precisely. The data was divided into two parts i.e. the training and testing dataset respectively. 
Models were developed based on training dataset excluding some observations which were kept for validation purpose, and then applied on the test dataset after finding accuracy of particular models to predict the respective values.

Predictive modeling performed on Ames Housing dataset using Machine Learning Algorithms like Linear, SVM, Random Forest, Decision Tree and Neural Net
